				<h3 id="thoughts">Things to think about before deciding what to bring.</h3>
					<ul>

						<li>Your units PPE standards may vary from location. Check beforehand to stay ahead of the game.</li>
						<li>Include enough of soilable items to last the time alloted for your field op. Even if able to wash less time wasted the better.</li>
