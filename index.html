		<h2>welcome to out super-duper scuba site</h2>

		<h3>"About us"</h3>
			<p>Bubble under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accomodation and travel, and to ensure that everyone gets a trust worthy dive buddy.
			</p><p>Although we're based in the south-west we don't stay on our own turf: past diving weekends have included trips up to scapa flow in scotland and to malta's numerouse wreck sites. </p><p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse. eh?).</p>
		<h3>"Contact us"</h3>
			<p>To find out more, Contact club secretary Bob Dobalina on 01793641207 or email bob!@bubbleunder.com.</p>				</body>
