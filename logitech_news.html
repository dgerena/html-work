		<h1>Logitech unifying receivers</h1>
		<p>Logitech has a history of creating inexpensive yet capable pc peripherals for years. There newest unifying receiver takes that one step further. The receiver allows multiple devices that would normally require individual receivers to link using a single receiver. </p>
		<h2>devices that use the receivers.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>logitech 2012 wireless keyboard.</li>
			<li>logitech m570 wireless trackball.</li>
			<li>logitech wireless stereo headset.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>current limitations of unifying receivers.</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Current series supports only a single device.<br/>
				Any device once set to a receiver must be reassigned to be used with another receiver. A device may only be synced to one receiver at any one time.</li>
				<li>The receiver has a limiting distance of 15 feet direct sight.<br/>
				This is further inhibited by obstacles brining most users to be next to said devices.</li>
				<li>Currently only supports one type of device on any one receiver.</li>
			</ol>
		<h4>In other words</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>One keyboard</li>
							<li>One Mouse</li>
							<li>One headset</li>
						</ul>
